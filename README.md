# Strassen
This is a experimental Job for my algorithm Homework.
I try to design a Class for counting the matrix.
My homework is implement the Strassen algorithm.
So I using polymorphism and operator overloading to help design recursive more easily. 
But in must time ,It need more time to distribute the data and need more space.
I will fix those probrem.
It's finished not yet.!!!!
